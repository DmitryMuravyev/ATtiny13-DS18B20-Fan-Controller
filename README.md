<h1>Features</h1> 

- Up to 8 digital temperature sensors (DS18B20).
- Automatically detects the presence of PWM control (4th fan wire).
- Operates in PWM or On/Off mode (in case if DC-DC converter or power MOSFET used).
- 19.5 kHz PWM.
- Rotation control with an attempt to restart in case of rotor stop.
- Step-down DC-DC converter for fan power supply (up to 38V input, up to 2A output).
- Linear voltage regulator for MCU power supply.
- Audio alerts.

The controller regulates the fan speed using PWM, and the full PWM range (0 - 100%) fits into the temperature range of 25째C - 40째C. Unlike the ATtiny10-based project, this device can poll up to 8 sensors and uses a single 12-38 volt power supply. In the case of connecting a fan without PWM control or without a speed sensor (2- 3-wire fans), the control is carried out for a temperature threshold of 30째C: if the hottest sensor's temperature below this limit, then a logical 0 is set at the 2nd pin of the chip, and if higher, then 1. This pin is used to control the EN pin of the DC-DC converter.
The controller also issues an audible alarm when the temperature of the hottest sensor exceeds the threshold of 50째C.

<h1>Details</h1>
You can find the project schematic, PCB drawing and other materials here: https://oshwlab.com/sneer2sneer/attini13-fan-controller

For your design you can use a minimum of elements (pullup resistors for the lines of the fan speed sensor and temperature sensor and a decoupling capacitor for power supply), but in my case the module schematic looks like this:

![Schematic_ATtiny13 Fan Controller](https://github.com/DmitryMuravyev/ATtiny13-DS18B20-Fan-Controller/assets/152902525/679d37cb-1003-4c54-84a1-87e3bccff85e)

For MCU Flash ROM programming you will need a USBasp programmer (or any other that supports the TPI - Tiny Programming Interface), which is connected according to this schematic:

![USBasp connection](https://github.com/DmitryMuravyev/ATtiny13-DS18B20-Fan-Controller/assets/152902525/4aefc9b0-fc66-466d-a2c7-79ef53251f01)

The programming itself is performed from the Arduino IDE, with the ATtiny13 core installed in it (see the links below).

${\color{red}Please \space note \space (!)}$ that by default, the 1st pin of the microcontroller is used for the RESET signal (active level is low). To use this pin as a GPIO pin, you must rewrite the microcontroller's fuses (see the command below). After you do this, you will no longer be able to flash the chip with a regular programmer. To program such a chip, you'll need 12V to be applied to the RESET pin.

${\color{red}Also \space note \space (!)}$ that the code is written for the MCU clock frequency of 5 MHz. This means that in the Arduino IDE, in the Tools->Clock menu, you should set the value to "4.8 MHz internal osc.", and then preferably calibrate the value of the OSCCAL register in the code for your specific exemplar of the chip. This can be done, for example, by uncommenting "Pulse generation" section of the code and measuring the duration of the pulses using an oscilloscope.
